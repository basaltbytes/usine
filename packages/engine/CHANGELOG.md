# @usine/engine

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b9d544: Adds operator takeover, session pause and resume, and edit-and-retry (protocol v5). A message to a child holds its result until release, holds pause the elapsed-time limit, and v3 and v4 transcripts stay readable.

### Patch Changes

- 5828a95: Persists Claude and Codex child sessions, and the run drawer shows copyable resume commands. Protocol v6 needs the orchestrator and run host upgraded together; v3 to v5 transcripts stay readable.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f80f88: Applies `settings.max_children` as a child-session budget per attempt; an excess spawn fails without a retry (protocol v4). v3 transcripts stay readable.
- 388e59d: Adds `usine export-run <runId>`, which saves a run's detail, attempts, and transcripts to a new JSON file (set the path with `--output <path>`). Adds `RunReader.evidence(runId)` and the read-only `runReaderLayer(instanceDirectory)`.
- a36f46e: Adds `max_cycles` (default 3 per loop), a per-item cycle budget with an ask when it's used up and a reset in the UI and API. Agents that share a GitHub App identity review with comments and outcome labels.
- 83edd04: Adds `usine backup <path>`, which copies the runtime database, including committed WAL data, while the orchestrator runs, and never overwrites an existing file.

### Patch Changes

- 162b323: Records executor defects as non-retryable attempt failures with safe operator messages, and matches task relationships by canonical PR paths.
- 5c47dc2: On SIGINT or SIGTERM, the orchestrator drains admitted attempts and defers queued work and retries until restart; a second signal forces a stop.
- b628897: Groups linked issue and PR items into board tasks with their run history and run and attempt counts.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- da13037: Runs attempts through an in-process Pi parent with the usine subagents extension and a headless Claude Code child, and streams typed session events over protocol v2.
- 16e7212: Adds per-repository board lane maps, item and label projections from polling, live run data on board cards, quarantined item diagnostics, and lane label moves through the operator API.
- a8d8df4: Adds the Drizzle-backed durable engine with approval, retry, supersede, revoke, and restart recovery; the Node adapter is `@usine/engine/local-sqlite`.
- 24eef02: Adds CLI port overrides, help and version output, and occupied-port diagnostics to `usine up`. The operator API hides infrastructure causes and limits transcript reads, and the drawer loads more than 500 rows.
- fb24c80: Adds Codex app-server and API-key-only Pi children to the subagents extension (protocol v3).
- ae86c6c: Adds `usine up` with a local UI that lists open and recent runs with their transcripts and offers approve, retry, cancel, pause, and unpause. Loop pause state persists in the runtime database.
- 6e61cbf: Adds the local worker runtime: scheduling, isolated Git worktrees, per-attempt credentials, durable transcripts, structured results, and cancellation.
- 1a9669d: Polls GitHub with conditional REST requests, stores trigger cursors in the run database, and turns matching loop state into durable events.

### Patch Changes

- 3041f9d: Moves `Instance.Directory` and `Loop.ApprovalRequirement` to `@usine/core`; `@usine/engine` still exports `InstanceDirectory` and `ApprovalRequirement`.
