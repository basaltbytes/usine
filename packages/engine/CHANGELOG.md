# @usine/engine

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0275eff: Adds attempt end times: `Attempt.endedAt` in `@usine/core`, an `ended_at` column in `usine_attempts`, and `AttemptView.endedAt` in `@usine/orchestrator/operator`. Attempts that ended before this change have no end time.
  
  The board shows each lane's labels, in their GitHub colors, and item states under its name. A card shows a run only while the run is open or failed and unresolved, with the time since the run opened, its current attempt started, or it failed, and the card menu lists only the actions that apply.
- d039c91: The engine drives runs instead of an Effect workflow: each open run has one fiber in the orchestrator, and usine's run tables are the only durable state. Approval, retry, cancel, supersede, and revoke behave as before.
  
  On the next start after the upgrade, the orchestrator drops `usine_workflow_commands`, `cluster_messages`, `cluster_replies`, and `cluster_migrations` from `.usine/runtime.sqlite`. A run that was running at shutdown goes through normal startup recovery, and run ids keep their values. `layerWithDatabase` takes a layer that provides only `RunDatabase`; the deployment still provides `Crypto`, which hashes dedup keys into run ids.
- 81c048b: `StepExecutor.execute` takes an `ExecutionSink`: the attempt's channel sink and `checkoutAcquired`, which the executor runs once preparation acquires the checkout. Until then, the engine reconciles a checkout that a restart kept for reattachment: canceling the run records the salvage and removes the checkout, and a failed reattachment reconciles it before the failure is recorded.
- af28e0e: An attempt that fails or is canceled records the comments and reviews it posted on its run's item, and the task page lists them for every ended attempt.
  
  Adds `Attempt.comments` and `AttemptChannel.Sink.comments` to `@usine/core`, `harvestPostedComments` to `@usine/core/step/harvest`, and `RunStore.recordComments` with a `comments_json` column in `usine_attempts` to `@usine/engine`. `TaskView.comments` in `@usine/orchestrator` includes these comments, newest first.
- 7db1cae: Fixes an orchestrator restart running the agent again when the attempt's parent had finished but the engine hadn't recorded the outcome. The engine finishes the open attempt with its stored result or failure, and fails it as interrupted only if nothing was stored.
  
  Adds `AttemptRuntime.finished`, `AttemptRuntime.recordResult`, `Executor.outcome`, and `StepExecutor.outcome`, and `Executor.isLive` is true for an attempt whose parent succeeded before its checkout was harvested. In `@usine/durable/testing`, a `StubStorage` task's `state` is a tagged value: `live`, `finished` with `report` and `result`, or `canceled`.
- ebfb373: A deleted or transferred issue that the queued-event recheck finds missing leaves the board's open lanes. `TriggerCondition.recheck` replaces `TriggerCondition.holds` and returns a `TriggerRecheck` from `@usine/engine/trigger-condition`: `matches`, `no-longer-matches`, or `item-gone`.
  
  For the last two, the engine revokes the item's queued events, and for `item-gone` it also calls `ItemProjectionWriter.markGone`. An adapter that can't tell returns `matches`, as it returned `true` before.
- af28e0e: `RunReader.closed({ limit })` returns the `limit` most recently closed runs, newest first, regardless of when they opened. The overview's **Last outcomes** uses it, so it lists a run that opened long ago and closed recently.
- 91e2b70: A loop file can set `permissions: read` to give its attempts a GitHub token that can't push (ADR 0011, amendment of 2026-10-19). The default, `write`, keeps the current token, and a `read` token keeps `pull_requests: write` and `issues: write`, so review loops still post.
  
  Adds `LoopPermissions` to `@usine/core/loop`, `LoopFile.permissions` to `@usine/config/loop`, and a permission level to `GitHubApp.workerToken`, `CheckoutRequest`, `CredentialProvider.issue`, and the engine's run records; a migration adds `permissions` to `usine_trigger_events`, with `write` for existing events. An exe.dev worker refuses `read` attempts with a `credentials` `WorkerCapabilityError`, a `read` checkout gets a pre-push hook that explains the refusal, and a failed `read` attempt is removed without salvage.
- 75a4fcf: The web UI opens on the desk instead of the Projects list. The desk shows **Needs you**, **Running now** (attempts in flight, with connectivity warnings), **Not moving** (matched items with no running attempt, each with the reason and the action that moves it again), **Last outcomes** (the 10 most recently closed runs), and each worker's slots and last preflight; the sidebar lists projects under a Desk entry.
  
  Adds `RunReader.sightings` (`LoopSighting`), `OperatorObservation.desk` (`DeskView`), the `LoopMatches` service, `PollCycle.repositoryPolls`, and `GET /api/desk`, which also responds in setup mode. A not-moving item has one reason: `AwaitingApproval`, `SuppressedForOperator`, `CycleBudgetUsedUp`, `RunFailed`, `ClosedUnchanged`, `LoopPaused`, `QueuedForWorker`, or `AwaitingPoll`. `OperatorObservation.layer` requires `ExpressionEngine` and `WorkerStatus`, and `WorkerStatus.idle` serves a process that runs no attempts.
- 01306e6: `harvestFacts` and `harvestPostedComments` leave out a comment or review that could belong to another attempt: one posted while another attempt of the same agent was open on the item, one posted after the attempt's window ended, or one created before the checkout was prepared and edited since. The harvest summary counts these as `ambiguous`, `outside`, and `edited`.
  
  `@usine/core/attempt` exports `AttemptWindow`, `windowOf`, `windowHolds`, `windowsOverlap`, and `AttemptWindows`. The harvest functions take `windows`, an `AttemptWindowsRead`, and `harvestFacts` fails with a `HarvestError` at the new `windows` stage if the read fails; `AttemptChannel.Sink` and `RecoverySink` add `windows`, which the engine reads with `RunStore.attemptWindows`.
- 99164fa: The local worker runs its Pi parent in the orchestrator as a durable task, and a live attempt reattaches after an orchestrator restart instead of failing.
  
  `@usine/executor/local` requires an `AttemptRuntime`, drops `LocalExecutorOptions.runHost`, probes harnesses with `@usine/agents/preflight` (override with `harnessReadiness`), and passes the parent task only the attempt's allowlisted environment. Adds `Executor.isLive`, `CheckoutRequest.reattach`, `StepExecutor.isLive`, `StepExecution.reattach`, `AttemptRecovery.open`, and `@usine/core/step/harvest`; `RunStore.beginAttempt` takes the run's live attempt id and can reattach it without spending a retry. The orchestrator's local `layer` requires the `AttemptRuntime`, and `runtimeLayer` provides `@usine/durable/live` on the instance directory.
- b601259: After an orchestrator restart, a reattached attempt's runaway guard resumes from its recorded totals instead of starting over, and sends each 80% warning at most once per attempt. If the guard can't read the transcript or unsupervised time, it cancels the parent task, records the salvage, and fails the attempt with an `InfraFailure`.
  
  Adds `AttemptChannel.Sink.transcript` to `@usine/core`, which the engine reads from the run tables, and `AttemptRuntime.recordUnsupervised`, `AttemptRuntime.unsupervised`, `AttemptRuntime.attached`, and `StubStorage.unsupervised` to `@usine/durable`. A wall-clock guard records its unsupervised time every 30 seconds, so a crash loses at most 30 seconds, and the wall clock starts once the launch registers the attempt's session.
- 3088f0e: Before a queued event opens a run, the engine rechecks whether the loop's trigger still matches the item through the new `TriggerCondition` port (`@usine/engine/trigger-condition`), which `layerWithDatabase` and the local SQLite layer require. An event that no longer matches is revoked, and a check that can't complete opens the run as before.
  
  The orchestrator rechecks against a fresh GitHub snapshot, so a run that pushes a commit and then swaps its trigger labels no longer starts a second run.
- 2fc760a: Renames the item-level hold to suppression, so hold means only the session hold. In `@usine/engine/engine`, the `Held` submission result becomes `Suppressed`, and in `@usine/engine/run-reader`, `LoopSighting.heldBy` becomes `suppressedBy`. In `@usine/orchestrator/operator`, `HeldForOperatorView` becomes `SuppressedForOperatorView`, whose tag is `SuppressedForOperator`. A migration renames the `usine_loop_items` columns `held_by_run_id` and `held_event_id` to `suppressed_by_run_id` and `suppressed_event_id` and keeps their values.
- 3f13b80: `StepExecutor.reserve` takes `worker: Option<WorkerName>`. With a worker, the lease comes only from that worker, and the scheduler serves the reservation before unnamed ones without blocking runs that another worker can take.
  
  `StepExecutor` adds `occupy(worker)`, which takes a slot at once for an attempt already running on the worker, even beyond `max_concurrent_attempts`, and logs a warning in that case.
- 42720dd: Operators can mark a failed run's latest failure resolved, clearing its attention flags but keeping its outcome, transcript, and retry controls. Later failures flag it again; stale requests are rejected.
- cba7d35: Operators can run a succeeded or canceled run again. `RunEngine.runAgain` takes a `RunAgainRequest` and records a new event for the run's item state with the dedup key `["operator-run-again", n, <trigger dedup key>]`; it returns `Claimed` or `CycleBlocked`, and fails for a run in another state or while another run of the loop is open on the item.
  
  Adds `canRunAgain` to `RunState.operatorActions`, `RunAgain` to `@usine/core/run/again`, the `usine_run_again_events` table, `runAgain` to `RunSnapshot`, `RunSummary`, and `RunView`, `Operator.runAgain` with the new `LoopNotFoundError`, and `POST /api/runs/:runId/run-again`. The drawer and run page offer **Run again** and **Edit and run again** on succeeded and canceled runs.
- 36788c2: Runs record who approved them, when, and through which channel, `ui` or `github-ask`. Adds `ApprovalSource` and `RunApproval` to `@usine/core/run/approval`, moves `OperatorLogin` from `@usine/config/factory` to `@usine/core/operator`, and `RunEngine.approve` and `RunStore.approve` take an `ApprovalSource`; a migration adds `channel` and `approver` to `usine_approvals`.
  
  `Operator.approve` takes the loaded instance and approves as the `operator` login in `usine.yaml`. `RunView.approval` is an `ApprovalView`, and the run page shows “Approved by <login> · <time> · from the UI” or “from the GitHub Ask”.
- f060b57: The run store records when a run closes in `usine_runs.closed_at`, and clears it when a retry reopens the run. `RunSummary` and `RunSnapshot` in `@usine/engine/run-reader` add `closedAt`, and `RunReader.closed` orders runs by it; add the field to code that constructs `RunSummary` or `RunSnapshot`.
- 8f43ed7: A run whose fiber hits a store failure no longer waits for the next restart. The fiber retries a failed store operation four times with exponential backoff from 100 ms, and the engine reconciles every `ReconcileInterval` (three minutes by default, from `@usine/engine/engine`), starting a fiber for every open run that has none, except runs waiting for approval.
- 6764fa7: The run page shows the worker, duration, token usage per pool and session, and why each attempt began. The outline groups consecutive turns of one session, and its error count includes only what the run ended with or the operator must read.
  
  Adds `AttemptStart` to `@usine/core/attempt/start` (`StartedByEvent`, `StartedByRetry`, `StartedByEditAndRetry`, `StartedByInfraRetry`, `StartedAfterRestart`), `Attempt.start`, `Attempt.reattachedAt`, `SessionTokensUpdated.costUsd`, and `brainPool`. `RunEngine.retry` takes a `RetryRequest`, `Operator.retry` takes the loaded instance, `RunDetailView` adds `worker`, `duration`, and `usage` (`RunUsageView`), and a migration adds `usine_attempts.start_json`, `usine_attempts.reattached_at`, and `usine_runs.next_start_json`.
- ec5c4d4: Adds `BoardMoves` to `@usine/engine/board-moves`, which records the operator's board moves in the new `usine_board_moves` table. `Operator.moveBoardItem` records each move before it sends the label swap, and `Operator.githubChanges` lists a matching label change as a `BoardMovedView`, so the run page shows it as the operator's move.
  
  Moves made before this change still show as the agent's label changes.
- b99cdc8: Adds `RunReader.events(runIds)`, which reads the event each run was opened for as `RunEvent` records, in one batch. The event's payload is the item as the trigger saw it.
- 466e711: When an attempt ends without success, the executor commits uncommitted changes, pushes HEAD to `usine/salvage/<run>/<attempt>`, shows the ref in the run drawer, and checks it out for the next retry.
  
  `max_attempt_minutes` and `max_attempt_tokens` have no default: an absent setting leaves that half of the runaway guard off, and an armed limit steers the parent once at 80% before tripping. Consumed tokens count output plus uncached input for Codex, Claude, and Pi. The attempt channel protocol is version 7, and stored protocol-v6 transcripts stay readable.
  
  Startup reconciles retained and crashed attempts before workflow recovery, work is retained if salvage inspection or a snapshot fails, and local credentials and exe.dev grants renew throughout an attempt.
- ba8e26f: `StepExecutor.workers` is an effect that lists the executor's current workers, including a removed worker until its last attempt ends. `RunEngine.discardLeftovers` reads it on each call and discards the leftovers of a removed worker only after its last attempt ends.

### Patch Changes

- 3ed742f: An agent's `[usine:blocked]` report ends the attempt with the new `BlockedFailure` instead of `AgentFailure`, and the loop suppresses the item as after a `QuestionFailure`, so it doesn't open a run on the agent's own blocker comment. Another item change, a non-matching sighting, a retry, or `RunEngine.resolveFailure` lifts the suppression.
  
  Adds `AgentBlockedError` to `@usine/agents/runtime` and `BlockedFailureView` to `@usine/orchestrator/operator`.
- e518906: Upgrades `drizzle-orm` to 1.0.0-rc.5-5935859. Fixes `Schema.TaggedErrorClass is not a function` in `@usine/engine/local-sqlite`, `usine backup`, and `usine export-run` on a plain install.
- 3ed742f: An open pull request that GitHub no longer has leaves the board's open lanes. The poll calls the new `ItemProjectionWriter.markGone`, which sets `goneAt` on the item's projection until a later poll sees the item again, and the board places a gone item by its closed state; a migration adds `gone_at` to `usine_item_projections`.
- 81c048b: The engine reconciles a checkout that a restart kept for reattachment as soon as the run closes the attempt without reattaching it, instead of at the next startup. The salvage is recorded before the next attempt starts from it; if `StepExecutor.interrupt` can't confirm that the parent task stopped, the checkout stays and the run waits for the next reconcile.
- 291d428: Adds `ItemProjectionReader.openIssues(repository)`: the numbers of open issue projections not marked gone.
- 8e2da2d: An agent asks the operator a question by starting its final answer with `[usine:question]`. The attempt ends with the new `QuestionFailure`, which never retries automatically, and **Needs you** shows the question; a child's question is passed to the parent as `AgentQuestionError`.
  
  The loop then suppresses the item: the next item state returns the new `Suppressed` submission result and opens no run. Another item change, a non-matching sighting, a retry, or marking the question answered with `RunEngine.resolveFailure` lifts the suppression.
- 4d4c6bd: Pins `@effect/platform-node-shared` to the version of `effect` these packages pin. Fixes `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` from the Node entry points and the `usine` command when a plain install resolved a release that needs a newer `effect`.
- 5870baf: Rewrites error messages, API errors, CLI output, and web UI text in the Google developer documentation style. Messages name the problem and the fix, use lowercase common nouns, and quote names from configuration, such as `worker "eu-one"`. The startup line in setup mode is now `usine is running in setup mode at …`.
- 3f13b80: After a restart, a reattached attempt occupies a slot of its worker, so the worker takes no new attempt beyond `max_concurrent_attempts`. At startup, the engine occupies a slot through `StepExecutor.occupy` for each attempt whose checkout it keeps for reattachment, and releases it only after `StepExecutor.interrupt` confirms that the parent task stopped. `RunStore.beginAttempt` logs `Reattached Attempt keeps its own Worker, not the reserved one` at error instead of warning.
- 6d70b40: Fixes startup reconciliation calling `StepExecutor.recover` once per service that the engine layer is provided to. `usine up` reconciles each attempt once instead of four times.
- 2729e91: Startup reconciles the leftover checkout of a succeeded attempt: both executors remove it without salvage or a credential. `RunStore.salvageCandidates` lists every attempt with a `succeeded` flag on `AttemptRecovery`, and the exe.dev executor lists each worker's leftover checkouts once per start.
- 7a5249f: While a worker that a reload removed still runs attempts, its **Worker not configured** entry in **Needs attention** shows how many and offers **Discard leftovers** only after they end. Adds `UnconfiguredWorkerNeed.running` and `RunReader.attemptsByWorker` (`WorkerAttempts.running`).
  
  `RunEngine.discardLeftovers` and `Operator.discardLeftovers` fail with `LeftoversDiscardRejectedError` for a worker that is declared or still runs attempts, and `POST /api/workers/:worker/discard-leftovers` returns 409 with it instead of `{ ok: true }`.
- d799713: An event whose run was canceled, superseded, or revoked, or a queued event that a revoke ignored, opens a new run when the item leaves that state and comes back to it, for example when a label is removed and added again. The new run's event has the dedup key `["reopened", n, <original key>]`, and the engine records each loop's last sighting of an item in the new `usine_loop_items` table.
- c604a43: At startup, the engine records the comments that an open attempt posted on its run's item if its parent task failed before the orchestrator stopped. `@usine/core/attempt/salvage` exports `RecoverySink`, which `Executor.recover` and `StepExecutor.recover` take instead of the salvage callback, with a `comments` recorder.
- f966404: An operator retry of a failed run, plain or edited, fails with `RunRetryBlockedError` (status 409 in the API) while another run of the same loop and item is open.
- e5d9483: Rewords TSDoc for `claimRun` and `RunStore.parkForApproval`.
- 1877119: A runtime store migration drops the index `usine_item_projection_repository`, a duplicate of the unique index `usine_item_projection_number`, and adds a `json_valid` check on `usine_attempts.salvage_json`.
- d933ab6: Each package writes its `tsc -b` build info under `dist/`, so removing `dist` also removes the incremental state. The build info isn't published.
- 32651fd: Startup skips reconciling attempts recorded on a worker that `usine.yaml` no longer declares, logs one warning per start, and lists each such worker in **Needs you** as an `UnconfiguredWorkerNeed` with its attempt count. Declaring the worker again reconciles them at the next start, and **Discard leftovers** (`POST /api/workers/:worker/discard-leftovers`, `RunEngine.discardLeftovers`) stops tracking them without changing the worker.
  
  Adds `StepExecutor.workers`, `RunReader.attemptsByWorker`, and a `leftovers_discarded_at` column in `usine_attempts`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b9d544: Adds operator takeover, session pause and resume, and edit-and-retry (protocol v5). A message to a child holds its result until release, holds pause the elapsed-time limit, and v3 and v4 transcripts stay readable.

### Patch Changes

- 5828a95: Persists Claude and Codex child sessions, and the run drawer shows copyable resume commands. Protocol v6 needs the orchestrator and run host upgraded together; v3 to v5 transcripts stay readable.

  - @usine/core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f80f88: Applies `settings.max_children` as a child-session budget per attempt; an excess spawn fails without a retry (protocol v4). v3 transcripts stay readable.
- 388e59d: Adds `usine export-run <runId>`, which saves a run's detail, attempts, and transcripts to a new JSON file (set the path with `--output <path>`). Adds `RunReader.evidence(runId)` and the read-only `runReaderLayer(instanceDirectory)`.
- a36f46e: Adds `max_cycles` (default 3 per loop), a per-item cycle budget with an ask when it's used up and a reset in the UI and API. Agents that share a GitHub App identity review with comments and outcome labels.
- 83edd04: Adds `usine backup <path>`, which copies the runtime database, including committed WAL data, while the orchestrator runs, and never overwrites an existing file.

### Patch Changes

- 162b323: Records executor defects as non-retryable attempt failures with safe operator messages, and matches task relationships by canonical PR paths.
- 5c47dc2: On SIGINT or SIGTERM, the orchestrator drains admitted attempts and defers queued work and retries until restart; a second signal forces a stop.
- b628897: Groups linked issue and PR items into board tasks with their run history and run and attempt counts.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- da13037: Runs attempts through an in-process Pi parent with the usine subagents extension and a headless Claude Code child, and streams typed session events over protocol v2.
- 16e7212: Adds per-repository board lane maps, item and label projections from polling, live run data on board cards, quarantined item diagnostics, and lane label moves through the operator API.
- a8d8df4: Adds the Drizzle-backed durable engine with approval, retry, supersede, revoke, and restart recovery; the Node adapter is `@usine/engine/local-sqlite`.
- 24eef02: Adds CLI port overrides, help and version output, and occupied-port diagnostics to `usine up`. The operator API hides infrastructure causes and limits transcript reads, and the drawer loads more than 500 rows.
- fb24c80: Adds Codex app-server and API-key-only Pi children to the subagents extension (protocol v3).
- ae86c6c: Adds `usine up` with a local UI that lists open and recent runs with their transcripts and offers approve, retry, cancel, pause, and unpause. Loop pause state persists in the runtime database.
- 6e61cbf: Adds the local worker runtime: scheduling, isolated Git worktrees, per-attempt credentials, durable transcripts, structured results, and cancellation.
- 1a9669d: Polls GitHub with conditional REST requests, stores trigger cursors in the run database, and turns matching loop state into durable events.

### Patch Changes

- 3041f9d: Moves `Instance.Directory` and `Loop.ApprovalRequirement` to `@usine/core`; `@usine/engine` still exports `InstanceDirectory` and `ApprovalRequirement`.

### Patch Changes

- 781b664: First publish of the nine usine blocks. `@usine/core` contains the event, run, step, and attempt domain model, the run state machine, and the attempt failure kinds.
