# @usine/orchestrator

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- da13037: Run Attempts through an in-process Pi parent with the usine subagents extension and a headless Claude Code child. Assemble prompts from the payload snapshot, agent persona, and CEL-rendered loop body; persist the effective brain and parent model; stream typed parent and child session events over protocol v2; and pass steer and interrupt controls to the live session.
- 16e7212: Add per-repository Board lane maps, durable projections of GitHub Items and repository labels from polling, live Run data on Board cards, quarantined Item diagnostics, and lane-scoped label moves through the operator API.
- 27004c2: Add the exe.dev Worker adapter and orchestrator composition. Attempts use native time-boxed GitHub integration grants, cached remote worktrees, protocol-v1 SSH channels, typed capability preflight, and idempotent cancellation and cleanup.
- 24eef02: Add CLI port overrides, help and version output, occupied-port diagnostics, and a two-second timeout when `usine up` opens the setup page. The operator API now returns attempts, needs, and transcript events without exposing infrastructure causes. Cold and live transcript reads have explicit response limits, and the web drawer can continue loading rows beyond its initial 500-row page. Concurrent overview requests reuse one projection computation, and local-worker polling budgets include their timing rationale.
- ae86c6c: Add `usine up` with a local observe-and-intervene UI. Persist Loop pause state in the runtime database; list every open Run plus the newest settled ones and project protocol transcripts; expose approve, retry, cancel, pause, and unpause through the embeddable orchestrator; and preserve durable observation while the foreground server waits for missing GitHub App credentials with trigger execution idle.
- 6e61cbf: Add the local worker runtime: capacity-aware scheduling, isolated Git worktrees, per-Attempt credentials, protocol-v2 run-host channels, durable transcripts, structured results, and cooperative cancellation with hard-kill cleanup.
- 1a9669d: Persist efficiency-only trigger cursors in the run database. Detect GitHub issue and pull-request changes with conditional REST polling, fetch and content-hash fixed GraphQL payload slices, and turn matching loop state into durable Events through the orchestrator polling service.
- 05937b8: Add clock-driven schedule triggers with IANA time zones, per-repository Tick fanout, latest-missed catch-up, and durable Event submission through the existing run engine.

### Patch Changes

- 781b664: First publish of the nine usine blocks. `@usine/core` ships the Event → Run → Step → Attempt domain model: branded ids, the typestate run state machine (pending → waiting → running → succeeded / failed / canceled), and the attempt-failure taxonomy (infra / agent / runaway) with the auto-retry law. The other eight blocks reserve their seams while the engine grows.
