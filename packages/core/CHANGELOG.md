# @usine/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5828a95: Persists Claude and Codex child sessions, and the run drawer shows copyable resume commands. Protocol v6 needs the orchestrator and run host upgraded together; v3 to v5 transcripts stay readable.
- 8b9d544: Adds operator takeover, session pause and resume, and edit-and-retry (protocol v5). A message to a child holds its result until release, holds pause the elapsed-time limit, and v3 and v4 transcripts stay readable.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f80f88: Applies `settings.max_children` as a child-session budget per attempt; an excess spawn fails without a retry (protocol v4). v3 transcripts stay readable.
- a36f46e: Adds `max_cycles` (default 3 per loop), a per-item cycle budget with an ask when it's used up and a reset in the UI and API. Agents that share a GitHub App identity review with comments and outcome labels.
- 333eacd: Adds `settings.parent_effort` in `usine.yaml` and `parent_effort` in agent files for the Pi parent's reasoning effort, which defaults to the child's. A parent model that can't run it fails with `UnsupportedEffortError`.
- 57a374f: Preflight checks harness executables and logins on local and exe.dev workers, and Codex requires codex-cli 0.144.0 with ChatGPT authentication. Capability gaps need operator action; incomplete checks are retried.

### Patch Changes

- 162b323: Records executor defects as non-retryable attempt failures with safe operator messages, and matches task relationships by canonical PR paths.
- bd45cf4: Collects pull request facts from GitHub using the attempt's final commit, and encodes PR and comment URLs as strings.
- e7adbd8: Derives operator actions from the run lifecycle rules.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- da13037: Runs attempts through an in-process Pi parent with the usine subagents extension and a headless Claude Code child, and streams typed session events over protocol v2.
- a8d8df4: Adds the Drizzle-backed durable engine with approval, retry, supersede, revoke, and restart recovery; the Node adapter is `@usine/engine/local-sqlite`.
- 27004c2: Adds the exe.dev worker adapter, with time-boxed GitHub integration grants, cached remote worktrees, capability preflight, and idempotent cleanup.
- 57d383b: Adds GitHub App authentication, installation discovery, per-project installation coverage, local credential loading (mode 0600), and single-repository worker tokens.
- fb24c80: Adds Codex app-server and API-key-only Pi children to the subagents extension (protocol v3).
- 6e61cbf: Adds the local worker runtime: scheduling, isolated Git worktrees, per-attempt credentials, durable transcripts, structured results, and cancellation.
- 1a9669d: Polls GitHub with conditional REST requests, stores trigger cursors in the run database, and turns matching loop state into durable events.
- 3041f9d: Moves `Instance.Directory` and `Loop.ApprovalRequirement` to `@usine/core`; `@usine/engine` still exports `InstanceDirectory` and `ApprovalRequirement`.

### Patch Changes

- 16e7212: Adds per-repository board lane maps, item and label projections from polling, live run data on board cards, quarantined item diagnostics, and lane label moves through the operator API.
- ae86c6c: Adds `usine up` with a local UI that lists open and recent runs with their transcripts and offers approve, retry, cancel, pause, and unpause. Loop pause state persists in the runtime database.
- bc17c21: Encodes rate-limit reset dates as ISO strings so session events round-trip through the run-host protocol.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 781b664: First publish of the nine usine blocks. `@usine/core` contains the event, run, step, and attempt domain model, the run state machine, and the attempt failure kinds.
