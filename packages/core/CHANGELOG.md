# @usine/core

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0fc7e8f: An attempt reports when its worker stops responding or a child can't reach its model provider. These reports don't stop or fail the attempt.
  
  Adds the payloads `WorkerUnresponsive`, `WorkerResponsive`, and their union `WorkerNotice` to `@usine/core/attempt/channel`, and the session events `ProviderRetrying` and `ProviderRecovered`, with the `ProviderRetries` count, to `@usine/core/agent/session`. Adds `notify` to `AttemptRuntime` in `@usine/durable/attempt-runtime`, which records a `WorkerNotice` in the transcript, and adds both worker payloads to `TranscriptPayload` in `@usine/orchestrator/operator`.
  
  On SSH and exe.dev workers, the executor probes the worker over a new SSH connection every minute, with `ConnectTimeout=20` and a 45-second limit. The run page shows the reports as yellow lines, and the current activity says what isn't responding and since when.
- 0275eff: Adds attempt end times: `Attempt.endedAt` in `@usine/core`, an `ended_at` column in `usine_attempts`, and `AttemptView.endedAt` in `@usine/orchestrator/operator`. Attempts that ended before this change have no end time.
  
  The board shows each lane's labels, in their GitHub colors, and item states under its name. A card shows a run only while the run is open or failed and unresolved, with the time since the run opened, its current attempt started, or it failed, and the card menu lists only the actions that apply.
- af28e0e: Adds an optional `at` to `Comment` in `@usine/core/step/result`: the time GitHub says the comment was posted. `TaskCommentView` in `@usine/orchestrator/operator` replaces `at` with `postedAt` and `attemptEndedAt`, and the task page dates comments and reviews by when they were posted.
- 759db71: Removes the run host byte protocol from `@usine/core/attempt/channel`: `Start`, `InputFrame`, `InputFrameFromJson`, `EnvelopeFromJson`, and `OutboundEnvelopeFromJson`. `admit` violation messages refer to the outbound channel instead of the run host.
- 31137ed: The executor opens and maintains its own SSH forward to each gateway's admin API (#249). In `@usine/config/factory`, `gateway.destination` and `gateway.admin_port` replace the admin API URL.
  
  `@usine/core/worker` adds `GatewayAdminPort`, `SshWorkerGateway` in `@usine/executor/ssh` takes `destination` and `adminPort` instead of `adminUrl`, and `sshWorkerAddressesOf(config)` in `@usine/orchestrator/ssh` passes both to the executor. The executor restarts a closed forward with a backoff from one second to one minute, sends a failed admin request once more through a reopened forward, and checks at preflight that the forward opens.
- af28e0e: An attempt that fails or is canceled records the comments and reviews it posted on its run's item, and the task page lists them for every ended attempt.
  
  Adds `Attempt.comments` and `AttemptChannel.Sink.comments` to `@usine/core`, `harvestPostedComments` to `@usine/core/step/harvest`, and `RunStore.recordComments` with a `comments_json` column in `usine_attempts` to `@usine/engine`. `TaskView.comments` in `@usine/orchestrator` includes these comments, newest first.
- 66f6b0b: Adds `GET /v1/providers` to the gateway admin API. It returns an `LlmProviderList` (`@usine/gateway/admin`) of the LLM providers the gateway has a credential for, with the credential kind, `api-key` or `subscription`, but never the credential; `@usine/core/worker` adds `GatewayCredentialKind`.
  
  `ChildSession` records `gatewayCredential`, `brainPool(brain, gatewayCredential)` takes it, and the new `sessionPool(session)` reads a recorded session's pool, so a Claude Code child whose gateway used an API key counts in `apiKeys` and is priced at the model's API rate. `AttemptRequest` (`@usine/durable/attempt-runtime`) requires `gatewayCredential`.
  
  At preflight, the SSH executor reads the gateway's Anthropic credential kind for a worker whose `llmProviders` lists `anthropic`. A gateway without an Anthropic credential fails preflight with a `gateway` capability error, and a gateway too old to respond keeps the Claude plan pool with a warning.
- a55d12d: `harvestFacts` and `harvestPostedComments` record a comment or review only if its body ends with the signature of the attempt's agent, so attempts of two agents on one item no longer record each other's comments. The harvest log counts other comments as `unsigned`.
  
  `githubSignature` moves from `@usine/agents/prompt` to `@usine/core/agent`, and `HarvestSpec` reads the RunSpec's `agent`.
- b49ed35: `harvestFacts` records the comments and reviews that the attempt's bot login posted on its run's item since the worker prepared the checkout, as `Comment` facts. An attempt whose parent's last turn answered the operator succeeds if it posted a comment or review on the item, instead of failing with `AgentFailure`.
  
  Adds `BotLogin` to `@usine/core/worker`, `Comment.kind` (`CommentKind`) to `@usine/core/step/result`, `RunSpec.preparedAt` and `RunSpec.botLogin` to `@usine/core/attempt/channel`, and `CheckoutRequest.botLogin` to `@usine/executor`. `stepExecutorLayer` and the local, SSH, and exe.dev engine compositions require `GitHubApp`.
- 91e2b70: A loop file can set `permissions: read` to give its attempts a GitHub token that can't push (ADR 0011, amendment of 2026-10-19). The default, `write`, keeps the current token, and a `read` token keeps `pull_requests: write` and `issues: write`, so review loops still post.
  
  Adds `LoopPermissions` to `@usine/core/loop`, `LoopFile.permissions` to `@usine/config/loop`, and a permission level to `GitHubApp.workerToken`, `CheckoutRequest`, `CredentialProvider.issue`, and the engine's run records; a migration adds `permissions` to `usine_trigger_events`, with `write` for existing events. An exe.dev worker refuses `read` attempts with a `credentials` `WorkerCapabilityError`, a `read` checkout gets a pre-push hook that explains the refusal, and a failed `read` attempt is removed without salvage.
- 990612d: An operator message to the Pi parent places a hold, as on a child (ADR 0018, amendment of 2026-10-19). After the parent answers, it waits for another message or **Release parent** instead of ending the attempt; a steer places no hold, and a message to a parent that waits on a child is queued until the child returns.
  
  Adds `InterventionState.queued` to `@usine/core/attempt/channel`, with a second receipt that reports delivery or `InterventionRejected`, and `AttemptReport.answeredOperator` and `harvestedResult` to `@usine/durable/attempt-runtime`. An attempt whose parent ended on its answer to the operator, with no commit, pull request, or comment, fails with `AgentFailure`, and the runaway guard's wall-clock ceiling pauses while the parent is held.
- 01306e6: `harvestFacts` and `harvestPostedComments` leave out a comment or review that could belong to another attempt: one posted while another attempt of the same agent was open on the item, one posted after the attempt's window ended, or one created before the checkout was prepared and edited since. The harvest summary counts these as `ambiguous`, `outside`, and `edited`.
  
  `@usine/core/attempt` exports `AttemptWindow`, `windowOf`, `windowHolds`, `windowsOverlap`, and `AttemptWindows`. The harvest functions take `windows`, an `AttemptWindowsRead`, and `harvestFacts` fails with a `HarvestError` at the new `windows` stage if the read fails; `AttemptChannel.Sink` and `RecoverySink` add `windows`, which the engine reads with `RunStore.attemptWindows`.
- 99164fa: The local worker runs its Pi parent in the orchestrator as a durable task, and a live attempt reattaches after an orchestrator restart instead of failing.
  
  `@usine/executor/local` requires an `AttemptRuntime`, drops `LocalExecutorOptions.runHost`, probes harnesses with `@usine/agents/preflight` (override with `harnessReadiness`), and passes the parent task only the attempt's allowlisted environment. Adds `Executor.isLive`, `CheckoutRequest.reattach`, `StepExecutor.isLive`, `StepExecution.reattach`, `AttemptRecovery.open`, and `@usine/core/step/harvest`; `RunStore.beginAttempt` takes the run's live attempt id and can reattach it without spending a retry. The orchestrator's local `layer` requires the `AttemptRuntime`, and `runtimeLayer` provides `@usine/durable/live` on the instance directory.
- b601259: After an orchestrator restart, a reattached attempt's runaway guard resumes from its recorded totals instead of starting over, and sends each 80% warning at most once per attempt. If the guard can't read the transcript or unsupervised time, it cancels the parent task, records the salvage, and fails the attempt with an `InfraFailure`.
  
  Adds `AttemptChannel.Sink.transcript` to `@usine/core`, which the engine reads from the run tables, and `AttemptRuntime.recordUnsupervised`, `AttemptRuntime.unsupervised`, `AttemptRuntime.attached`, and `StubStorage.unsupervised` to `@usine/durable`. A wall-clock guard records its unsupervised time every 30 seconds, so a crash loses at most 30 seconds, and the wall clock starts once the launch registers the attempt's session.
- 2729e91: Startup reconciles the leftover checkout of a succeeded attempt: both executors remove it without salvage or a credential. `RunStore.salvageCandidates` lists every attempt with a `succeeded` flag on `AttemptRecovery`, and the exe.dev executor lists each worker's leftover checkouts once per start.
- 42720dd: Operators can mark a failed run's latest failure resolved, clearing its attention flags but keeping its outcome, transcript, and retry controls. Later failures flag it again; stale requests are rejected.
- cba7d35: Operators can run a succeeded or canceled run again. `RunEngine.runAgain` takes a `RunAgainRequest` and records a new event for the run's item state with the dedup key `["operator-run-again", n, <trigger dedup key>]`; it returns `Claimed` or `CycleBlocked`, and fails for a run in another state or while another run of the loop is open on the item.
  
  Adds `canRunAgain` to `RunState.operatorActions`, `RunAgain` to `@usine/core/run/again`, the `usine_run_again_events` table, `runAgain` to `RunSnapshot`, `RunSummary`, and `RunView`, `Operator.runAgain` with the new `LoopNotFoundError`, and `POST /api/runs/:runId/run-again`. The drawer and run page offer **Run again** and **Edit and run again** on succeeded and canceled runs.
- 36788c2: Runs record who approved them, when, and through which channel, `ui` or `github-ask`. Adds `ApprovalSource` and `RunApproval` to `@usine/core/run/approval`, moves `OperatorLogin` from `@usine/config/factory` to `@usine/core/operator`, and `RunEngine.approve` and `RunStore.approve` take an `ApprovalSource`; a migration adds `channel` and `approver` to `usine_approvals`.
  
  `Operator.approve` takes the loaded instance and approves as the `operator` login in `usine.yaml`. `RunView.approval` is an `ApprovalView`, and the run page shows “Approved by <login> · <time> · from the UI” or “from the GitHub Ask”.
- 6764fa7: The run page shows the worker, duration, token usage per pool and session, and why each attempt began. The outline groups consecutive turns of one session, and its error count includes only what the run ended with or the operator must read.
  
  Adds `AttemptStart` to `@usine/core/attempt/start` (`StartedByEvent`, `StartedByRetry`, `StartedByEditAndRetry`, `StartedByInfraRetry`, `StartedAfterRestart`), `Attempt.start`, `Attempt.reattachedAt`, `SessionTokensUpdated.costUsd`, and `brainPool`. `RunEngine.retry` takes a `RetryRequest`, `Operator.retry` takes the loaded instance, `RunDetailView` adds `worker`, `duration`, and `usage` (`RunUsageView`), and a migration adds `usine_attempts.start_json`, `usine_attempts.reattached_at`, and `usine_runs.next_start_json`.
- 466e711: When an attempt ends without success, the executor commits uncommitted changes, pushes HEAD to `usine/salvage/<run>/<attempt>`, shows the ref in the run drawer, and checks it out for the next retry.
  
  `max_attempt_minutes` and `max_attempt_tokens` have no default: an absent setting leaves that half of the runaway guard off, and an armed limit steers the parent once at 80% before tripping. Consumed tokens count output plus uncached input for Codex, Claude, and Pi. The attempt channel protocol is version 7, and stored protocol-v6 transcripts stay readable.
  
  Startup reconciles retained and crashed attempts before workflow recovery, work is retained if salvage inspection or a snapshot fails, and local credentials and exe.dev grants renew throughout an attempt.
- 7b157ff: Runs attempts on SSH workers behind a gateway, with no GitHub token on the worker machine (ADR 0027).
  
  In `@usine/config/factory`, an `ssh` worker takes an optional `gateway` with `domain`, `destination`, `admin_port` (default 7070), `admin_token_env` (the environment variable that contains the admin token, which never goes in the file), and `llm_providers` (`[anthropic]` if the gateway has the Anthropic credential). `@usine/core/worker` adds `GatewayDomain` and `GatewayLlmProvider`, and `@usine/gateway/admin` exports `AttachmentId`, `InstallationCredential`, `CallerToken`, and `GATEWAY_TOKEN_HEADER`.
  
  The SSH executor attaches each attempt's token to the gateway instead of writing it on the machine, clones from `http://git.<domain>/`, and sends the caller token only through SSH `SendEnv`. Preflight checks the admin API, that sshd accepts the `SendEnv` variables, and access to `git.<domain>`, and reports a gap as a `WorkerCapabilityError` with the new `gateway` capability; it refuses a Codex brain, and a Claude brain unless the gateway has the Anthropic credential.
  
  The SSH layer requires an `HttpClient`, `RemoteAccess` adds `shell`, `RemoteWorker.repositoryUrl` takes the machine, and `sshWorkerAddressesOf(config)` fails at startup with the variable's name if an admin token variable is unset.
- 7882203: Adds an `ssh` worker kind for any Linux machine that the orchestrator connects to over SSH (ADR 0026). In `usine.yaml`, an `ssh` worker takes `destination` (`user@host` or an SSH configuration alias), optional `identity_file` and `port`, and `root`, the directory for `workers/<name>` on the machine.
  
  `WORKER_KINDS` in `@usine/core/worker` adds `"ssh"` with the `SshDestination`, `SshPort`, `SshIdentityFile`, and `WorkerRoot` schemas, `Worker` in `@usine/config/factory` is a union of `LocalWorker`, `ExeDevWorker`, and `SshWorker`, and `@usine/executor/ssh` is a new adapter. Each attempt's token is written next to the worker's checkouts with mode 600 and removed when the attempt ends; all attempts on a worker run as one SSH user and can read each other's tokens (#231).
  
  `@usine/orchestrator/ssh` composes the engine with the SSH executor and exports `sshWorkersOf(config)`. `runtimeLayer` and `operatorObservationLayer` move from `@usine/orchestrator/local` to `@usine/orchestrator/runtime`, and `runtimeLayer(instanceDirectory, instance)` no longer takes local executor options and selects the SSH executor when every worker is `ssh`. The exe.dev adapter's span and log names change to `RemoteExecutor.*` and "remote".

### Patch Changes

- 3ed742f: An agent's `[usine:blocked]` report ends the attempt with the new `BlockedFailure` instead of `AgentFailure`, and the loop suppresses the item as after a `QuestionFailure`, so it doesn't open a run on the agent's own blocker comment. Another item change, a non-matching sighting, a retry, or `RunEngine.resolveFailure` lifts the suppression.
  
  Adds `AgentBlockedError` to `@usine/agents/runtime` and `BlockedFailureView` to `@usine/orchestrator/operator`.
- 8e2da2d: An agent asks the operator a question by starting its final answer with `[usine:question]`. The attempt ends with the new `QuestionFailure`, which never retries automatically, and **Needs you** shows the question; a child's question is passed to the parent as `AgentQuestionError`.
  
  The loop then suppresses the item: the next item state returns the new `Suppressed` submission result and opens no run. Another item change, a non-matching sighting, a retry, or marking the question answered with `RunEngine.resolveFailure` lifts the suppression.
- 5870baf: Rewrites error messages, API errors, CLI output, and web UI text in the Google developer documentation style. Messages name the problem and the fix, use lowercase common nouns, and quote names from configuration, such as `worker "eu-one"`. The startup line in setup mode is now `usine is running in setup mode at …`.
- c604a43: At startup, the engine records the comments that an open attempt posted on its run's item if its parent task failed before the orchestrator stopped. `@usine/core/attempt/salvage` exports `RecoverySink`, which `Executor.recover` and `StepExecutor.recover` take instead of the salvage callback, with a `comments` recorder.
- 42780b5: A retried attempt starts from the run's current revision, the default branch tip for an issue run, and rebases the previous attempt's salvage onto it. A salvage with no changes is dropped, and one that doesn't rebase cleanly stays on its branch and appears in the new `RunSpec.conflictingSalvage` and `Started.conflictingSalvage`, which the prompt and transcript mention.
- e5d9483: Rewords TSDoc for `awaitApproval` and `supersede`.
- d933ab6: Each package writes its `tsc -b` build info under `dist/`, so removing `dist` also removes the incremental state. The build info isn't published.
- a3a230c: `harvestFacts` runs `git ls-remote origin` to check whether a ref points at the attempt's new final commit before it asks GitHub for the commit's pull requests. An unpushed commit is recorded with no pull request and a debug log line, instead of an HTTP 422 and two warnings.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5828a95: Persists Claude and Codex child sessions, and the run drawer shows copyable resume commands. Protocol v6 needs the orchestrator and run host upgraded together; v3 to v5 transcripts stay readable.
- 8b9d544: Adds operator takeover, session pause and resume, and edit-and-retry (protocol v5). A message to a child holds its result until release, holds pause the elapsed-time limit, and v3 and v4 transcripts stay readable.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f80f88: Applies `settings.max_children` as a child-session budget per attempt; an excess spawn fails without a retry (protocol v4). v3 transcripts stay readable.
- a36f46e: Adds `max_cycles` (default 3 per loop), a per-item cycle budget with an ask when it's used up and a reset in the UI and API. Agents that share a GitHub App identity review with comments and outcome labels.
- 333eacd: Adds `settings.parent_effort` in `usine.yaml` and `parent_effort` in agent files for the Pi parent's reasoning effort, which defaults to the child's. A parent model that can't run it fails with `UnsupportedEffortError`.
- 57a374f: Preflight checks harness executables and logins on local and exe.dev workers, and Codex requires codex-cli 0.144.0 with ChatGPT authentication. Capability gaps need operator action; incomplete checks are retried.

### Patch Changes

- 162b323: Records executor defects as non-retryable attempt failures with safe operator messages, and matches task relationships by canonical PR paths.
- bd45cf4: Collects pull request facts from GitHub using the attempt's final commit, and encodes PR and comment URLs as strings.
- e7adbd8: Derives operator actions from the run lifecycle rules.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- da13037: Runs attempts through an in-process Pi parent with the usine subagents extension and a headless Claude Code child, and streams typed session events over protocol v2.
- a8d8df4: Adds the Drizzle-backed durable engine with approval, retry, supersede, revoke, and restart recovery; the Node adapter is `@usine/engine/local-sqlite`.
- 27004c2: Adds the exe.dev worker adapter, with time-boxed GitHub integration grants, cached remote worktrees, capability preflight, and idempotent cleanup.
- 57d383b: Adds GitHub App authentication, installation discovery, per-project installation coverage, local credential loading (mode 0600), and single-repository worker tokens.
- fb24c80: Adds Codex app-server and API-key-only Pi children to the subagents extension (protocol v3).
- 6e61cbf: Adds the local worker runtime: scheduling, isolated Git worktrees, per-attempt credentials, durable transcripts, structured results, and cancellation.
- 1a9669d: Polls GitHub with conditional REST requests, stores trigger cursors in the run database, and turns matching loop state into durable events.
- 3041f9d: Moves `Instance.Directory` and `Loop.ApprovalRequirement` to `@usine/core`; `@usine/engine` still exports `InstanceDirectory` and `ApprovalRequirement`.

### Patch Changes

- 16e7212: Adds per-repository board lane maps, item and label projections from polling, live run data on board cards, quarantined item diagnostics, and lane label moves through the operator API.
- ae86c6c: Adds `usine up` with a local UI that lists open and recent runs with their transcripts and offers approve, retry, cancel, pause, and unpause. Loop pause state persists in the runtime database.
- bc17c21: Encodes rate-limit reset dates as ISO strings so session events round-trip through the run-host protocol.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 781b664: First publish of the nine usine blocks. `@usine/core` contains the event, run, step, and attempt domain model, the run state machine, and the attempt failure kinds.
