# @usine/agents

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5828a95: Persists Claude and Codex child sessions, and the run drawer shows copyable resume commands. Protocol v6 needs the orchestrator and run host upgraded together; v3 to v5 transcripts stay readable.
- 8b9d544: Adds operator takeover, session pause and resume, and edit-and-retry (protocol v5). A message to a child holds its result until release, holds pause the elapsed-time limit, and v3 and v4 transcripts stay readable.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [5828a95]
- Updated dependencies [8b9d544]
  - @usine/core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f80f88: Applies `settings.max_children` as a child-session budget per attempt; an excess spawn fails without a retry (protocol v4). v3 transcripts stay readable.
- 333eacd: Adds `settings.parent_effort` in `usine.yaml` and `parent_effort` in agent files for the Pi parent's reasoning effort, which defaults to the child's. A parent model that can't run it fails with `UnsupportedEffortError`.
- 57a374f: Preflight checks harness executables and logins on local and exe.dev workers, and Codex requires codex-cli 0.144.0 with ChatGPT authentication. Capability gaps need operator action; incomplete checks are retried.

### Patch Changes

- 34aeb4a: Upgrades Pi to 0.85.1 and the Claude Agent SDK to 0.3.261. Pi supports GPT-6 Astra with OpenAI API keys or Codex subscriptions, and Claude Fable 5.1 with Anthropic API keys.
- a36f46e: Adds `max_cycles` (default 3 per loop), a per-item cycle budget with an ask when it's used up and a reset in the UI and API. Agents that share a GitHub App identity review with comments and outcome labels.
- 28ec315: Supports Codex CLI 0.153.4 and stops Codex child processes, including leftover background commands, before their sessions complete.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- da13037: Runs attempts through an in-process Pi parent with the usine subagents extension and a headless Claude Code child, and streams typed session events over protocol v2.
- fb24c80: Adds Codex app-server and API-key-only Pi children to the subagents extension (protocol v3).
- 684757f: The Pi parent can use a ChatGPT subscription through the `openai-codex` provider, and has no repository coding tools, so work goes to the child.
