# @usine/agents

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 460d50b: Retry temporary model provider capacity refusals automatically, with a delay and the existing three-attempt cap. Retries resume from salvaged work; the run page shows the provider message and the next attempt time. The retry deadline survives orchestrator restarts and cancellation stops the wait.
  
  Add typed capacity failures, child reports, and provider retry starts. Codex and Claude use structured overload codes where available, while message-only errors recognize capacity refusals, HTTP 529, and HTTP 503 with a retry hint. Other task failures retain their existing behavior.

### Patch Changes

- a7692ae: Upgrade the Codex protocol baseline and worker images to 0.164.0, which includes updated TLS certificate roots. Preflight rejects 0.153.4 and accepts 0.159.0 through 0.159.3 for one release while existing worker images upgrade. The gateway model-provider configuration remains compatible. Claude Code stays at 2.1.308.
- 93bbe77: Upgrade the Pi packages to 1.4.0 and define the checkpoint policies required by pi-durable. Attempt and hold documents retain their existing delta-storage behavior. Disable the task restart limit to preserve automatic resumption after repeated crashes.
  
  Back up the instance with `usine backup <path>` before upgrading. Starting the upgraded server migrates `durable.sqlite` to SQLite storage schema version 2, which pi-durable 1.3.0 and earlier cannot open. Do not downgrade usine past this release: `usine upgrade <older version>` cannot reverse the storage migration.
- 06a10bf: Disable Codex plugin and app sync, startup update checks, and analytics in child and preflight commands. Disable Claude Code's claude.ai connectors and nonessential traffic in the attempt environment on every worker kind.
- f54b3bd: Record the provider login in `PoolRateLimitsUpdated.login`. Codex records the ChatGPT login email and refreshes it after an account change. Older snapshots and gateway-backed sessions remain readable without a login.
- 98eb9cd: Document the public agent API, including harness SDK contracts, session errors, child hosts, and prompt inputs.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 113d150: Preflight accepts Codex CLI 0.153.4 and 0.159.0 through 0.159.3, and refuses 0.144.0. The protocol conformance baseline is `@pwrdrvr/codex-app-server-protocol` 0.159.2. `@usine/agents/preflight` exports `supportedCodexVersions`.
- 9c7ea97: Requires `effect` 4.0.6 instead of 4.0.0-rc.111 ([#494](https://github.com/basaltbytes/usine/issues/494)).

### Patch Changes

- 1f7b315: Change the license from MIT to AGPL-3.0-only. Versions published before this one stay under MIT.
- 2f78d3a: A remote Claude child whose SSH connection breaks, for example while the orchestrator's machine sleeps, resumes its saved session instead of failing ([#603](https://github.com/basaltbytes/usine/issues/603)). The backend stops the Claude process left on the worker with the new `CHILD_STOP_SCRIPT`, then starts Claude with `resume` in the same child session, so the parent spends no child budget. It tries after 5 s, 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min, and fails the child as before after the last try. A child whose Claude process exits on its own, or that runs on the orchestrator's machine, still fails.
  
  `claudeChildLayer` and `claudeChildBackendLayer` require a `ChildProcessSpawner`. `/child-host` exports `SSH_FAILURE`, the exit code of the OpenSSH client when the connection fails.
- 1514af9: On a provisioned worker, the Claude login lock covers one machine instead of the whole worker ([#591](https://github.com/basaltbytes/usine/issues/591)). Each machine has its own login, so a Claude child or preflight check on one machine no longer waits for a Claude start on another. A worker's long-lived machine keeps one lock for all its attempts.
  
  `ClaudeLoginLock.withLock(worker, machine)` takes the provider's `MachineId` of a provisioned machine, or `None` for the worker's shared login. `ChildRequest` and `AttemptRequest` require `machine`, which the executor sets from the attempt's machine. `AttemptRequest.machine` isn't stored; each `execute` call supplies it.
- 4942c44: Codex children on an SSH worker behind a gateway can use the gateway's OpenAI credential, a ChatGPT login or an API key, instead of a login on the worker. A worker's `gateway.llm_providers` accepts `openai` beside `anthropic` (`GatewayLlmProvider`).
  
  With `openai` listed, the executor writes Codex's `config.toml` with a `model_provider` for `llm.<domain>/openai/v1` to the attempt's Codex home, `<root>/workers/<name>/codex/<attempt>`, exports that directory as `CODEX_HOME`, and sends the caller token as `USINE_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, over SSH (which the worker's sshd must accept in `AcceptEnv`) or to the attempt's container. The container mounts the Codex home read-write, and cleanup removes it after the container; `RemoteAccess` adds `writablePaths` for it. Preflight reads the gateway's OpenAI credential kind, checks only the `codex` binary and its version, and logs each provider's mode (`gateway-api-key`, `gateway-subscription`, or `worker-login`) in `SSH Worker Gateway verified`.
  
  A Codex child with a gateway credential skips the login check and ignores login changes; `brainPool` puts it in `apiKeys` for an API key and in `chatgptPlan` otherwise. `@usine/agents/preflight` exports `unsupportedCodexVersion`.
- 80f2eb6: `HarnessSession` has an optional `home`: the directory the harness saved the session in when the attempt set one in place of the harness's default. A Codex child records its `CODEX_HOME` there and in the `Codex child session saved` log, so a resume command can find a session that an attempt behind a gateway saved in its own Codex home. Older records decode `home` to `Option.none()`.
- 3d54b01: Codex sessions now have a price. `SessionTokensUpdated` has an optional `breakdown` of input, cached input, cache write, and output tokens, which Codex children report. `@usine/agents/openai-prices` exports `openAiPrice`, which prices a breakdown at OpenAI's API rates for the models that the supported Codex CLI versions list.
  
  Run and task usage prices a Codex session that its harness didn't price from that table, marked as an estimate in the ChatGPT plan and not in the API keys pool. ChatGPT plan sessions that Pi prices keep Pi's figure, now shown as an estimate. A Codex model without rates stays unpriced and is logged once. The run page shows ChatGPT plan prices instead of `No dollar rate`.
- d82c6cd: A Pi child gets only Pi's default tools: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, and `write`. Before, the global Pi `defaultTools` setting could add tools such as `grep` and `find`, which run `rg` and `fd` with the orchestrator's environment and its secrets. `bash` still runs with exactly `ChildRequest.environment`.
  
  The `Started` result of `PiSdk.start` adds `tools`, the names of the session's active tools, which the Pi child backend logs at debug level.
- 266986a: The nine `@earendil-works/*` packages are at 1.2.0. pi-durable 1.2 closes the harness on any storage error, a read included, so `DurableHarness` now handles a failed harness instead of a poisoned session or a stuck step:
  
  - An attempt that is running when a storage error fails the harness fails with a retryable `InfraFailure` whose cause is the new `DurableStorageFailed`, and the engine retries it from salvage. The harness reopens the storage, aborts those attempts' tasks, and resumes the other tasks.
  - A storage error before the harness resumes its tasks fails the layer with a `DurableHarnessError` that names the error, and `usine up` doesn't start.
  - If the reopen fails, or the reopened harness fails within a minute, the harness stops until the orchestrator restarts.
  
  `HarnessListener` replaces `onReopen` and `onStop` with `onFailure`, `BeforeResume` also receives the storage, and `StuckStepReports` is removed. The `subagent` tool returns the child's report as `output`, the field that pi-durable 1.2 reads instead of `content`.
- 4c63872: The Pi preflight session's `bash` tool now gets the worker's environment instead of inheriting the orchestrator's. Preflight never prompts, so no tool ran, but the session was built as if it might.
- 2183c07: An SSH worker whose machine has Docker runs each attempt in its own container, so attempts on one machine can't read each other's checkouts, tokens, caller tokens, or processes.
  
  - The container runs the image that `workers[].container.image` names in `usine.yaml`, or `ghcr.io/basaltbytes/usine-worker` at the harness versions of the release (`ATTEMPT_IMAGE` in `@usine/executor/ssh`). `cpus`, `memory_mib`, and `pids` limit each container.
  - It mounts only the attempt's checkout and the SSH user's harness login files read-write, and its cached clone and credential directory read-only. It uses the machine's network and gets the attempt's variables, secrets included, on `docker run`'s standard input.
  - Every command for the attempt runs in it with `docker exec`: the children, git in the checkout, the harvest, the salvage, the pre-push hook, and the attempt's harness check. The checkout is a repository of its own that reads the cached clone's objects through an alternate.
  - The container is removed with the checkout. Before a process starts its first container on a worker, it removes the containers that earlier processes of the instance left on that machine.
  - Preflight checks Docker, pulls the image, checks the image's user ID, and probes the harnesses in a container from the image. Only a machine without Docker, whose SSH user has no Docker access, runs attempts as the SSH user; preflight reports the worker as degraded in the log, on the Workers page, and on the desk. With Docker, a Docker that doesn't answer fails preflight.
  - A file outside every container's mounts records each checkout that a container had, so a reattachment or recovery never runs git in it as the SSH user, whatever the attempt changed in the checkout. A checkout from before Docker on a machine that now has it, or a container's checkout on a machine that no longer has Docker, is refused and left for the operator.
  
  `Executor.preflight` returns a `PreflightReport`, `SshExecutorOptions` takes the `instance` label, `SshWorkerAddress` takes `container`, and `RemoteShell` takes an optional `container` that wraps each command line in `docker exec`. `infra/worker-image/Dockerfile` defines the image, and cloud-init installs Docker.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0fc7e8f: An attempt reports when its worker stops responding or a child can't reach its model provider. These reports don't stop or fail the attempt.
  
  Adds the payloads `WorkerUnresponsive`, `WorkerResponsive`, and their union `WorkerNotice` to `@usine/core/attempt/channel`, and the session events `ProviderRetrying` and `ProviderRecovered`, with the `ProviderRetries` count, to `@usine/core/agent/session`. Adds `notify` to `AttemptRuntime` in `@usine/durable/attempt-runtime`, which records a `WorkerNotice` in the transcript, and adds both worker payloads to `TranscriptPayload` in `@usine/orchestrator/operator`.
  
  On SSH and exe.dev workers, the executor probes the worker over a new SSH connection every minute, with `ConnectTimeout=20` and a 45-second limit. The run page shows the reports as yellow lines, and the current activity says what isn't responding and since when.
- 425e240: A message to a working child shows as queued until the child reads it, as for a delegating parent. The run page and drawer show it as "Queued until the child finishes its current step".
  
  `RunningSession.intervene` in `@usine/agents/runtime` takes an `OnDelivery` callback and returns `InterventionState.queued` for a message that the harness reads at its next boundary. A child emits `SessionResumed` only if it was idle or paused. The durable attempt runtime records queued input in `AttemptRecordDoc.queuedInputs` and sends a second receipt, `InterventionApplied` or `InterventionRejected`, and the `@usine/durable/testing` stub child queues messages and adds `readQueued`.
- 8292038: `ChildRequest` contains the child's complete environment, and Claude Code, the Codex app server, and the Pi child's bash tool run with only that environment. `@usine/agents/pi/authentication` exports `splitPiModel`, `piAuthentication`, `requiredPiPool`, and `resolvePiPool`.
- d062b4d: Fixes Claude children failing when two attempts start on one worker and share its Claude login. A Claude child whose first turn fails with `Failed to refresh OAuth token: another Claude Code process ...` without spending tokens restarts after 15, 30, then 60 seconds.
  
  Adds `ClaudeLoginLock` and `ChildRequest.worker` to `@usine/agents/runtime`, and exports `claudeLoginLockLayer` from `@usine/executor`. `claudeChildLayer`, `claudeChildBackendLayer`, the local, exe.dev, and SSH executor layers, the `@usine/durable/live` `layer`, and the `@usine/orchestrator` worker compositions require `ClaudeLoginLock`. Provide one `claudeLoginLockLayer` to both the executor and the attempt runtime.
- caf041d: Removes the Pi parent runtime, which runs in `@usine/durable`: `@usine/agents/pi/live`, `AgentRuntime`, `LaunchRequest`, `ChildSessions`, `piParentLayer`, the subagents extension, and the `typebox` dependency. Removes `PiStartOptions.toolMode`, makes `PiStartOptions.model` a required `ModelId`, and removes `requiredPool` from the `AuthenticationUnavailable` and `UnsupportedAuthentication` start results.
- a55d12d: `harvestFacts` and `harvestPostedComments` record a comment or review only if its body ends with the signature of the attempt's agent, so attempts of two agents on one item no longer record each other's comments. The harvest log counts other comments as `unsigned`.
  
  `githubSignature` moves from `@usine/agents/prompt` to `@usine/core/agent`, and `HarvestSpec` reads the RunSpec's `agent`.
- ebfb373: A child's harness failure, such as a failed Codex turn, ends the attempt with `AgentFailure` and no longer suppresses the item. Only `[usine:blocked]` ends an attempt with `BlockedFailure`.
  
  `@usine/agents/runtime` adds `FAILED_MARKER` (`[usine:failed]`), which `reportText` writes for an `AgentResultError` and `reportedOutcome` reads back. The `@usine/durable/testing` stub child adds `fail`, and the run page's reader hides the marker.
- 0799f4f: `ChildRequest.host` sets where a child runs: `LocalProcess`, or `RemoteShell`, which runs each child through one SSH command in the worktree. `@usine/agents/child-host` also exports `sshArguments` and `CHILD_KILL_SCRIPT`; Claude Code and Codex children support a remote host, and Pi children refuse it with `AgentResultError`.
  
  `preflight(brain, host, environment)` and `verifyHarness(brain, host, environment)` take the host and environment to check. On a `RemoteShell` host, probes run over SSH, an SSH failure is an incomplete check, and a Pi brain is unavailable.
- 6764fa7: The run page shows the worker, duration, token usage per pool and session, and why each attempt began. The outline groups consecutive turns of one session, and its error count includes only what the run ended with or the operator must read.
  
  Adds `AttemptStart` to `@usine/core/attempt/start` (`StartedByEvent`, `StartedByRetry`, `StartedByEditAndRetry`, `StartedByInfraRetry`, `StartedAfterRestart`), `Attempt.start`, `Attempt.reattachedAt`, `SessionTokensUpdated.costUsd`, and `brainPool`. `RunEngine.retry` takes a `RetryRequest`, `Operator.retry` takes the loaded instance, `RunDetailView` adds `worker`, `duration`, and `usage` (`RunUsageView`), and a migration adds `usine_attempts.start_json`, `usine_attempts.reattached_at`, and `usine_runs.next_start_json`.
- 466e711: When an attempt ends without success, the executor commits uncommitted changes, pushes HEAD to `usine/salvage/<run>/<attempt>`, shows the ref in the run drawer, and checks it out for the next retry.
  
  `max_attempt_minutes` and `max_attempt_tokens` have no default: an absent setting leaves that half of the runaway guard off, and an armed limit steers the parent once at 80% before tripping. Consumed tokens count output plus uncached input for Codex, Claude, and Pi. The attempt channel protocol is version 7, and stored protocol-v6 transcripts stay readable.
  
  Startup reconciles retained and crashed attempts before workflow recovery, work is retained if salvage inspection or a snapshot fails, and local credentials and exe.dev grants renew throughout an attempt.

### Patch Changes

- 3ed742f: An agent's `[usine:blocked]` report ends the attempt with the new `BlockedFailure` instead of `AgentFailure`, and the loop suppresses the item as after a `QuestionFailure`, so it doesn't open a run on the agent's own blocker comment. Another item change, a non-matching sighting, a retry, or `RunEngine.resolveFailure` lifts the suppression.
  
  Adds `AgentBlockedError` to `@usine/agents/runtime` and `BlockedFailureView` to `@usine/orchestrator/operator`.
- acef6eb: Upgrades `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` to 0.3.308, which bundles Claude Code 2.1.308 without the compromised eMudhra certificate authorities. Claude children still run the worker's own `claude` from PATH.
- a3a230c: Preflight reports a logged-out Claude Code worker as needing `claude auth login` instead of as a failed command. Other non-zero exits and output that isn't a login status still report the command as failed.
- 66f6b0b: Adds `GET /v1/providers` to the gateway admin API. It returns an `LlmProviderList` (`@usine/gateway/admin`) of the LLM providers the gateway has a credential for, with the credential kind, `api-key` or `subscription`, but never the credential; `@usine/core/worker` adds `GatewayCredentialKind`.
  
  `ChildSession` records `gatewayCredential`, `brainPool(brain, gatewayCredential)` takes it, and the new `sessionPool(session)` reads a recorded session's pool, so a Claude Code child whose gateway used an API key counts in `apiKeys` and is priced at the model's API rate. `AttemptRequest` (`@usine/durable/attempt-runtime`) requires `gatewayCredential`.
  
  At preflight, the SSH executor reads the gateway's Anthropic credential kind for a worker whose `llmProviders` lists `anthropic`. A gateway without an Anthropic credential fails preflight with a `gateway` capability error, and a gateway too old to respond keeps the Claude plan pool with a warning.
- 8e2da2d: An agent asks the operator a question by starting its final answer with `[usine:question]`. The attempt ends with the new `QuestionFailure`, which never retries automatically, and **Needs you** shows the question; a child's question is passed to the parent as `AgentQuestionError`.
  
  The loop then suppresses the item: the next item state returns the new `Suppressed` submission result and opens no run. Another item change, a non-matching sighting, a retry, or marking the question answered with `RunEngine.resolveFailure` lifts the suppression.
- 5519ca3: The Pi backend checks a model's effort with `getSupportedThinkingLevels` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, as the Pi parent does. `@usine/agents` depends on `@earendil-works/pi-ai` 1.1.0 directly.
- 9b78093: Upgrades `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` to 1.1.0; the Pi parent's steer reports whether the message was handled or queued.
- 458033e: A Pi child records provider retries as `ProviderRetrying`, with Pi's message and the turn's retry count, and recovery as `ProviderRecovered`, like Codex and Claude Code children.
- e518906: Pins `@earendil-works/pi-codemode` to 1.1.0, next to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 1.1.0. Fixes a `SyntaxError` in `@usine/durable/live`, the executor and orchestrator entry points that load it, and `usine up` when a plain install resolved pi-codemode 1.3.0, which doesn't export `MCP_TYPESCRIPT_PREAMBLE`.
- 7078fa8: Pins the `@earendil-works` packages `chord`, `pi-agent-core`, `pi-mcp`, `pi-telemetry`, and `pi-tui` to 1.1.0, matching `pi-coding-agent`, so a plain install gets the workspace's versions.
- 5870baf: Rewrites error messages, API errors, CLI output, and web UI text in the Google developer documentation style. Messages name the problem and the fix, use lowercase common nouns, and quote names from configuration, such as `worker "eu-one"`. The startup line in setup mode is now `usine is running in setup mode at …`.
- 71c8b48: Claude children stay open until background work and notification turns finish. An agent reports an unresolved blocker with the `[usine:blocked]` marker, which fails the attempt without a retry.
- 07a4145: An attempt fails if the Pi parent paraphrases a child's `[usine:blocked]` report; the parent receives the report with its marker intact.
- 42780b5: A retried attempt starts from the run's current revision, the default branch tip for an issue run, and rebases the previous attempt's salvage onto it. A salvage with no changes is dropped, and one that doesn't rebase cleanly stays on its branch and appears in the new `RunSpec.conflictingSalvage` and `Started.conflictingSalvage`, which the prompt and transcript mention.
- 7b157ff: Runs attempts on SSH workers behind a gateway, with no GitHub token on the worker machine (ADR 0027).
  
  In `@usine/config/factory`, an `ssh` worker takes an optional `gateway` with `domain`, `destination`, `admin_port` (default 7070), `admin_token_env` (the environment variable that contains the admin token, which never goes in the file), and `llm_providers` (`[anthropic]` if the gateway has the Anthropic credential). `@usine/core/worker` adds `GatewayDomain` and `GatewayLlmProvider`, and `@usine/gateway/admin` exports `AttachmentId`, `InstallationCredential`, `CallerToken`, and `GATEWAY_TOKEN_HEADER`.
  
  The SSH executor attaches each attempt's token to the gateway instead of writing it on the machine, clones from `http://git.<domain>/`, and sends the caller token only through SSH `SendEnv`. Preflight checks the admin API, that sshd accepts the `SendEnv` variables, and access to `git.<domain>`, and reports a gap as a `WorkerCapabilityError` with the new `gateway` capability; it refuses a Codex brain, and a Claude brain unless the gateway has the Anthropic credential.
  
  The SSH layer requires an `HttpClient`, `RemoteAccess` adds `shell`, `RemoteWorker.repositoryUrl` takes the machine, and `sshWorkerAddressesOf(config)` fails at startup with the variable's name if an admin token variable is unset.
- d933ab6: Each package writes its `tsc -b` build info under `dist/`, so removing `dist` also removes the incremental state. The build info isn't published.

  - @usine/core@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5828a95: Persists Claude and Codex child sessions, and the run drawer shows copyable resume commands. Protocol v6 needs the orchestrator and run host upgraded together; v3 to v5 transcripts stay readable.
- 8b9d544: Adds operator takeover, session pause and resume, and edit-and-retry (protocol v5). A message to a child holds its result until release, holds pause the elapsed-time limit, and v3 and v4 transcripts stay readable.

  - @usine/core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f80f88: Applies `settings.max_children` as a child-session budget per attempt; an excess spawn fails without a retry (protocol v4). v3 transcripts stay readable.
- 333eacd: Adds `settings.parent_effort` in `usine.yaml` and `parent_effort` in agent files for the Pi parent's reasoning effort, which defaults to the child's. A parent model that can't run it fails with `UnsupportedEffortError`.
- 57a374f: Preflight checks harness executables and logins on local and exe.dev workers, and Codex requires codex-cli 0.144.0 with ChatGPT authentication. Capability gaps need operator action; incomplete checks are retried.

### Patch Changes

- 34aeb4a: Upgrades Pi to 0.85.1 and the Claude Agent SDK to 0.3.261. Pi supports GPT-6 Astra with OpenAI API keys or Codex subscriptions, and Claude Fable 5.1 with Anthropic API keys.
- a36f46e: Adds `max_cycles` (default 3 per loop), a per-item cycle budget with an ask when it's used up and a reset in the UI and API. Agents that share a GitHub App identity review with comments and outcome labels.
- 28ec315: Supports Codex CLI 0.153.4 and stops Codex child processes, including leftover background commands, before their sessions complete.

### Minor Changes

- da13037: Runs attempts through an in-process Pi parent with the usine subagents extension and a headless Claude Code child, and streams typed session events over protocol v2.
- fb24c80: Adds Codex app-server and API-key-only Pi children to the subagents extension (protocol v3).
- 684757f: The Pi parent can use a ChatGPT subscription through the `openai-codex` provider, and has no repository coding tools, so work goes to the child.
