# @usine/cloudflare

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b3e696a: Adds the `cloudflare` Worker kind, which runs each attempt in its own Cloudflare sandbox ([#551](https://github.com/basaltbytes/usine/issues/551)).
  
  - `@usine/cloudflare` is the Worker that you deploy to your Cloudflare account: a Durable Object per attempt that owns one container from a named image, a WebSocket exec stream whose commands keep pid, log, and exit-code files so a dropped stream can attach again, a stop that ends every process that a command started, including what it left running after it exited, a keepalive alarm that also keeps a held sandbox running, an image init that records the platform's SIGTERM, and outbound handlers that add the attempt's installation token for `github.com` and `api.github.com` and the provider API key for Claude Code and Codex, only on the provider routes that the harnesses call. Each sandbox applies its credential changes one at a time and refuses credentials older than the ones it holds, so a delayed renewal can't undo a revocation. The container receives no credential and reaches no other host, except the hosts in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Every request needs the Cloudflare Access service token headers. The package also exports the sandbox API contract, the stream messages, and the harness environment, and ships the Wrangler configuration and the image's Dockerfile.
  - `@usine/config` accepts `kind: cloudflare` workers with `worker_url`, `access_client_id_env`, `access_client_secret_env`, `image`, `instance_type` (default `standard-4`), and `llm_providers`, each with an `api_key_env`. `@usine/core` adds `cloudflare` to the Worker kinds, and the `CloudflareInstanceType`, `CloudflareImageName`, and `CloudflareLlmProvider` schemas.
  - `@usine/executor/cloudflare` creates a sandbox per attempt, checks the attempt's harness version in it before it grants credentials, runs each child, git, and gh command in it through the sandbox shell, renews the installation token in the Worker, stops the sandbox's commands and destroys it when the attempt ends, revokes the credentials of a sandbox that it keeps and holds it until it reconciles or destroys it, drains an attempt within the platform's 15 minutes after SIGTERM by salvaging its checkout and failing it retryably, reattaches a live attempt after a restart, and destroys a worker's orphan sandboxes. Sandbox names and orphan cleanup are scoped to the usine instance, the GitHub App, so instances that share a deployed Worker keep apart. Preflight checks the Worker's health route, its image, the provider keys, and the image's Claude Code and Codex versions. Each child reports the outbound handler's API key as its credential, so a Codex child runs without a ChatGPT login check, and Claude Code and Codex children count in the API keys pool.
  - `@usine/orchestrator` runs the instance on the Cloudflare executor when every worker is `cloudflare`, and its new `/cloudflare` subpath reads each worker's Access service token and provider keys at startup.
  
  Sandboxes can't be kept in the EU: the Sandbox SDK 1.0 needs the `durable_object` scheduling policy, which rejects `jurisdiction` placement.
- 9c7ea97: Requires `effect` 4.0.6 instead of 4.0.0-rc.111 ([#494](https://github.com/basaltbytes/usine/issues/494)). The sandbox API still answers a create or credentials body with an unknown key with 400, through `HttpApi.PayloadParseOptions` on the sandbox group. Effect 4.0 ignores the payload annotation that did this before.
