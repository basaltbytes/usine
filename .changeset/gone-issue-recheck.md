A deleted or transferred issue that the queued-event recheck finds missing leaves the board's open lanes. `TriggerCondition.recheck` replaces `TriggerCondition.holds` and returns a `TriggerRecheck` from `@usine/engine/trigger-condition`: `matches`, `no-longer-matches`, or `item-gone`.

For the last two, the engine revokes the item's queued events, and for `item-gone` it also calls `ItemProjectionWriter.markGone`. An adapter that can't tell returns `matches`, as it returned `true` before.
