Register harness preflight and launch through `Harnesses` on `@usine/agents/harness/node`. Registration rejects incomplete descriptor/runtime pairs and duplicate IDs. Gateway, injected-key, and Cloudflare preflight use the registered runtime with their credential route. Refusal messages name the harness and its installation location, mention a login only for host-login probes, and retain sandbox-image guidance for Cloudflare. Successful binary probes log the installed version.

Replace the three harness-specific backend tags with `ChildBackend`, and rename the single-harness layers to `claudeChildLayer`, `codexChildLayer`, and `piChildLayer`. Replace `ClaudeLoginLock` and `claudeLoginLockLayer` with `HostLoginLock` and `hostLoginLockLayer`; `withLock` takes the harness ID before the worker and machine. Share one lock layer between the executor and attempt runtime.

`preflight` accepts a `ProbeTarget` and requires the injected `Harnesses` service. Build the registry once with the process spawner and shared `HostLoginLock`, then provide it to the executors and durable attempt runtime. Registration errors remain typed until the server reports a startup failure. It returns capability gaps as readiness reports and fails on transport errors or timeouts. Custom `HarnessProbe` wrappers forward the worker and machine context in their second argument.
