Behind a gateway, Codex, and Claude Code if the gateway has no Anthropic credential, use the operator's login on the worker machine and reach their provider through the gateway's forward proxy (ADR 0027, amendment of 2026-10-15).

Preflight on an SSH worker behind a gateway accepts these brains if the machine reaches each login host through the forward proxy: `api.anthropic.com` and `platform.claude.com` for Claude Code, `chatgpt.com` and `auth.openai.com` for Codex. A refused host fails preflight with a `gateway` capability error that names the host to add to the egress allowlist, and `SshExecutorOptions.harnessReadiness` replaces only the login and binary checks.
