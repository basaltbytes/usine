The local worker runs its Pi parent in the orchestrator as a durable task, and a live attempt reattaches after an orchestrator restart instead of failing.

`@usine/executor/local` requires an `AttemptRuntime`, drops `LocalExecutorOptions.runHost`, probes harnesses with `@usine/agents/preflight` (override with `harnessReadiness`), and passes the parent task only the attempt's allowlisted environment. Adds `Executor.isLive`, `CheckoutRequest.reattach`, `StepExecutor.isLive`, `StepExecution.reattach`, `AttemptRecovery.open`, and `@usine/core/step/harvest`; `RunStore.beginAttempt` takes the run's live attempt id and can reattach it without spending a retry. The orchestrator's local `layer` requires the `AttemptRuntime`, and `runtimeLayer` provides `@usine/durable/live` on the instance directory.
