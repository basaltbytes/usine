A loop file can set `permissions: read` to give its attempts a GitHub token that can't push (ADR 0011, amendment of 2026-10-19). The default, `write`, keeps the current token, and a `read` token keeps `pull_requests: write` and `issues: write`, so review loops still post.

Adds `LoopPermissions` to `@usine/core/loop`, `LoopFile.permissions` to `@usine/config/loop`, and a permission level to `GitHubApp.workerToken`, `CheckoutRequest`, `CredentialProvider.issue`, and the engine's run records; a migration adds `permissions` to `usine_trigger_events`, with `write` for existing events. An exe.dev worker refuses `read` attempts with a `credentials` `WorkerCapabilityError`, a `read` checkout gets a pre-push hook that explains the refusal, and a failed `read` attempt is removed without salvage.
