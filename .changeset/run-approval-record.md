Runs record who approved them, when, and through which channel, `ui` or `github-ask`. Adds `ApprovalSource` and `RunApproval` to `@usine/core/run/approval`, moves `OperatorLogin` from `@usine/config/factory` to `@usine/core/operator`, and `RunEngine.approve` and `RunStore.approve` take an `ApprovalSource`; a migration adds `channel` and `approver` to `usine_approvals`.

`Operator.approve` takes the loaded instance and approves as the `operator` login in `usine.yaml`. `RunView.approval` is an `ApprovalView`, and the run page shows “Approved by <login> · <time> · from the UI” or “from the GitHub Ask”.
