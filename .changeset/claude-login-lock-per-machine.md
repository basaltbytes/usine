On a provisioned worker, the Claude login lock covers one machine instead of the whole worker ([#591](https://github.com/basaltbytes/usine/issues/591)). Each machine has its own login, so a Claude child or preflight check on one machine no longer waits for a Claude start on another. A worker's long-lived machine keeps one lock for all its attempts.

`ClaudeLoginLock.withLock(worker, machine)` takes the provider's `MachineId` of a provisioned machine, or `None` for the worker's shared login. `ChildRequest` and `AttemptRequest` require `machine`, which the executor sets from the attempt's machine. `AttemptRequest.machine` isn't stored; each `execute` call supplies it.
