An open pull request or failing item that GitHub no longer has no longer stops its repository's poll. The poll logs a warning, drops the item from the cursor, and revokes its unstarted runs; `GitHubPolling.snapshot` fails with `GitHubItemNotFoundError`, exported from `@usine/github/polling`, when the item is missing or GraphQL reports `NOT_FOUND`.
