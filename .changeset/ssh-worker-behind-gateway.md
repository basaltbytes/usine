Runs attempts on SSH workers behind a gateway, with no GitHub token on the worker machine (ADR 0027).

In `@usine/config/factory`, an `ssh` worker takes an optional `gateway` with `domain`, `destination`, `admin_port` (default 7070), `admin_token_env` (the environment variable that contains the admin token, which never goes in the file), and `llm_providers` (`[anthropic]` if the gateway has the Anthropic credential). `@usine/core/worker` adds `GatewayDomain` and `GatewayLlmProvider`, and `@usine/gateway/admin` exports `AttachmentId`, `InstallationCredential`, `CallerToken`, and `GATEWAY_TOKEN_HEADER`.

The SSH executor attaches each attempt's token to the gateway instead of writing it on the machine, clones from `http://git.<domain>/`, and sends the caller token only through SSH `SendEnv`. Preflight checks the admin API, that sshd accepts the `SendEnv` variables, and access to `git.<domain>`, and reports a gap as a `WorkerCapabilityError` with the new `gateway` capability; it refuses a Codex brain, and a Claude brain unless the gateway has the Anthropic credential.

The SSH layer requires an `HttpClient`, `RemoteAccess` adds `shell`, `RemoteWorker.repositoryUrl` takes the machine, and `sshWorkerAddressesOf(config)` fails at startup with the variable's name if an admin token variable is unset.
