Add opt-in machine reuse for Boat and Hetzner SSH workers with `provisioner.reuse: { attempts: 5, max_age: 2h }`. Reuse requires Docker, successful cleanup, gateway attachment revocation, and preflight before each assignment. Machines retire at the attempt or age limit and when their worker connection is removed.

Show machine assignment counts and age on the overview and worker page, and persist daily machine-start counts for statistics.
