Declares nullable GitHub payload fields, such as a team review request's `requestedReviewer.login`, as nullable in the CEL environment. On a null field, a comparison with a value is false, a comparison with `null` works either way, and `has()` below it is false; `ObjectField` takes a `nullable` flag, and prompts accept a `null` result.
