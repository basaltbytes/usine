Operators can run a succeeded or canceled run again. `RunEngine.runAgain` takes a `RunAgainRequest` and records a new event for the run's item state with the dedup key `["operator-run-again", n, <trigger dedup key>]`; it returns `Claimed` or `CycleBlocked`, and fails for a run in another state or while another run of the loop is open on the item.

Adds `canRunAgain` to `RunState.operatorActions`, `RunAgain` to `@usine/core/run/again`, the `usine_run_again_events` table, `runAgain` to `RunSnapshot`, `RunSummary`, and `RunView`, `Operator.runAgain` with the new `LoopNotFoundError`, and `POST /api/runs/:runId/run-again`. The drawer and run page offer **Run again** and **Edit and run again** on succeeded and canceled runs.
