Adds `GitHubItemHistory.appChanges(repository, item, since)` to `@usine/github/item-history`, which returns the App's label changes, comments, and reviews on an item as `LabelAdded`, `LabelRemoved`, `Commented`, and `Reviewed`; `Installation` adds `appSlug`. `Operator.githubChanges(runId)` returns each attempt's changes as `RunGitHubChangesView` at `GET /api/runs/:runId/github-changes`, which returns 404 `GitHubItemNotFoundError` for an item that GitHub no longer has.

The run page shows each label change, comment, and review that an agent made on the item where it happened.
