Needs attention no longer lists entries about an issue that is closed or a pull request that is closed or merged. Each poll closes the item's cycle-budget ask with the reason `ItemClosed` and records it in the new `usine_cycle_ask_closures` table. The closure isn't a reset: the item keeps its generation and reservations, so a reopened item at its limit asks again. A failed run on such an item keeps `canResolveFailure` but isn't listed, and its drawer says `Issue closed`, `Pull request closed`, or `Pull request merged`.

Adds `CycleBudgets.close` and `CycleBudgetAskCloseReason` to `@usine/engine/cycle-budget`, `ItemProjectionReader.get` to `@usine/engine/item-projection`, `RunDetailView.settledItemState` to `@usine/orchestrator/operator`, and `SettledItemState` to `@usine/config/board`.
