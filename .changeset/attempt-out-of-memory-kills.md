The run page shows how many processes the kernel killed for memory in an attempt's containers on an SSH worker, and separately gives the memory limit of the last container with recorded kills, under the attempt's outcome (#600). Before, a command that needed more than `memory_mib`, such as Chromium or Vitest during `pnpm test`, was killed while the container kept running, and only the agent saw it.

- Before the release removes an attempt's container, it reads the `oom_kill` count of the container's cgroup from `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.events`, and counts one more for each start after the kernel killed the container's init, since a start gives the container a new cgroup. A count above zero is recorded through `Sink.outOfMemory` with the container's ID, and a warning logs it as `The kernel killed processes in the container for memory`. A reattachment runs the attempt in a new container, whose kills add to those of the earlier container. A count that can't be read or recorded is logged and doesn't stop the removal.
- `@usine/core/attempt` exports `OutOfMemoryKills`, with `kills` and `memoryMib`, `ContainerOutOfMemoryKills`, which adds the `container` ID, `totalOutOfMemoryKills`, and `Attempt.outOfMemory`. `@usine/core/worker` exports `ContainerId`. `AttemptChannel.Sink` has `outOfMemory`, which takes one container's kills.
- `RunStore.recordOutOfMemory` stores each container's kills in the new `out_of_memory_json` column of `usine_attempts`, and replaces the count of a container recorded before. `Attempt.outOfMemory` and `AttemptView.outOfMemory` add up the kills of the attempt's containers, with the memory limit of the last one, or return none and null.
