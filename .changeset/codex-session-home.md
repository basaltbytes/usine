`HarnessSession` has an optional `home`: the directory the harness saved the session in when the attempt set one in place of the harness's default. A Codex child records its `CODEX_HOME` there and in the `Codex child session saved` log, so a resume command can find a session that an attempt behind a gateway saved in its own Codex home. Older records decode `home` to `Option.none()`.
