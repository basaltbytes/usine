The new instance setting `settings.max_background_wait_minutes` limits how long a child that answers while its background tasks still run waits for that work to start a turn. The default is no limit: such a child waits for its background work and the turn it starts, however long they take. **Configuration > Settings** shows and edits the setting.

Claude Code children apply the limit. When it passes and the child is still idle, the child returns its last answer as its report, and a warning names the limit and the background task IDs. Closing the child ends the Claude Code process, which stops its background tasks, and their results never reach the Attempt. The child's `SessionFinished` event sets `backgroundWaitLimitPassed`, and when the Attempt ends, even as a success, cleanup salvages its checkout as after a failure, so work that the child hasn't pushed is kept. Cleanup applies the limit that the Attempt started with. If that salvage doesn't push all the work, the checkout stays, and startup recovery salvages it again instead of removing it. A turn that starts within the limit runs to its own answer. If the operator holds or pauses the child when the limit passes, the child stays open without reporting idle. A Release of a held child then returns the answer, unless a turn started first. If the Claude process resumes in the meantime, the child reports the kept answer as idle, and a Release returns it. The limit runs in memory, so a child that was already waiting when usine restarted waits without one.
