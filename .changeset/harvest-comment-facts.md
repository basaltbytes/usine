`harvestFacts` records the comments and reviews that the attempt's bot login posted on its run's item since the worker prepared the checkout, as `Comment` facts. An attempt whose parent's last turn answered the operator succeeds if it posted a comment or review on the item, instead of failing with `AgentFailure`.

Adds `BotLogin` to `@usine/core/worker`, `Comment.kind` (`CommentKind`) to `@usine/core/step/result`, `RunSpec.preparedAt` and `RunSpec.botLogin` to `@usine/core/attempt/channel`, and `CheckoutRequest.botLogin` to `@usine/executor`. `stepExecutorLayer` and the local, SSH, and exe.dev engine compositions require `GitHubApp`.
