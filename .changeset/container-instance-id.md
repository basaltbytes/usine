Two instance folders that share a GitHub App and an SSH worker machine no longer remove each other's attempt containers at startup.

- `usine up` reads the instance ID from `.usine/instance-id`, and writes a new UUID there at its first start. A file that doesn't contain a UUID stops `usine up` with status 1 instead of being replaced, because with a new ID usine no longer removes the containers it left before.
- Each attempt container gets the label `dev.usine.instance-id=<instance ID>` beside `dev.usine.instance=github-app-<App ID>`, and a process removes only the containers that have both its labels. A container that an earlier version left after a crash has no ID label, so no process removes it; remove such containers once with `docker rm`.
- `@usine/core/instance` adds `InstanceId`. `SshExecutorOptions` requires `instanceId`, and `runtimeLayer` and `workerEngineLayer` in `@usine/orchestrator` take it after the instance directory.
