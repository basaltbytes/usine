`StepExecutor.execute` takes an `ExecutionSink`: the attempt's channel sink and `checkoutAcquired`, which the executor runs once preparation acquires the checkout. Until then, the engine reconciles a checkout that a restart kept for reattachment: canceling the run records the salvage and removes the checkout, and a failed reattachment reconciles it before the failure is recorded.
