A refused `POST /api/instance/reload` returns the refusal's typed fields with `error` and `message`: `blocks` and `fields` for `RestartRequiredError` (409), `agents`, `workers`, and `cause` for `ReloadPreflightError` (409), and `file` and `stage` for `FactoryConfigError` (422). The Configuration section lists what the refusal names, each linked to its page.

`@usine/orchestrator/operator/http` exports `RestartRequiredRefusal`, `ReloadPreflightRefusal`, `FactoryConfigRefusal` (`ReloadRefusal`), `ReloadPreflightFailure`, and `reloadRefusal`, and the derived client decodes a refused reload into one of them.
