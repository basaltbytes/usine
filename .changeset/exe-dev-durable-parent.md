The exe.dev worker runs its Pi parent in the orchestrator as a durable task and its Claude Code and Codex children on the VM over SSH, so an exe.dev attempt reattaches after an orchestrator restart instead of failing. A Pi brain is unavailable on exe.dev.

`@usine/executor/exe-dev` requires an `AttemptRuntime` and no longer launches the run host: it removes `ExeDevExecutorOptions.runHost`, `RunHostCommand`, and the `run-host` worker capability, and `ExeDevExecutorOptions.ssh` takes an `SshCommand` from `@usine/agents/child-host`. Preflight runs the `@usine/agents/preflight` checks on the VM over SSH, and the `@usine/orchestrator/exe-dev` `layer` requires an `AttemptRuntime`.
