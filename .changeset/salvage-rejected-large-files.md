A salvage push that GitHub refuses for a file over its size limit (`GH001`) is now recorded as `Rejected`, and startup recovery doesn't push the same commit again. Before, the salvage recorded it as `Retained`, and every startup pushed the checkout again before the HTTP server listened, about a minute each time, and GitHub refused it each time (#581).

`@usine/core/attempt/salvage` adds `SalvageRejected` to `AttemptSalvage`, with the worktree's `path`, the refused `commit`, and the remote's `message`. `AttemptRecovery` requires `rejected`, the attempt's recorded `SalvageRejected` or `None`, and the engine's salvage candidates fill it from the stored salvage. The executors keep the worktree, the provisioned machine, or the Cloudflare sandbox of a `Rejected` salvage as they do for a `Retained` one. Recovery records the same `Rejected` salvage while the checkout's head is the refused commit, and salvages and pushes again once the checkout changes. A recovery that can't inspect the checkout, or can't commit its changes on top of the refused commit, also records the same `Rejected` salvage instead of `Retained`, so that a later startup doesn't push the refused commit again. The run drawer shows the rejected work's path and GitHub's message.
