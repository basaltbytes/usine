`@usine/config/board` exports `isSettledItemState`, true for `issue-closed`, `pr-closed`, and `pr-merged`, which the board projection and the web UI's Done lanes use. `BoardTaskView` adds `updatedAt` and `pullRequest` (`BoardPullRequestView`); add both to code that constructs a `BoardTaskView`.

The web UI adds a tasks list per project at `/projects/<owner>/<name>/tasks`, with each task's current item, state, lane, loops, run count, last run, and pull request, and a **Done** toggle (`?done=1`) for closed and merged tasks. The sidebar shows **Board** and **Tasks** under each project.
