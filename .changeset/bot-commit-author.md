Attempts commit as the GitHub App's bot account on every worker kind. Before, a local worker's commits took the identity in the operator's global git config, unless the agent passed one itself.

`@usine/core/worker` adds `BotAccount`, a bot's `BotLogin` and `BotUserId`, with its ID-based noreply address in `noreplyEmail`. `GitHubApp.botAccount()` returns the App's bot account, read from `GET /users/<slug>[bot]` once per App slug; the bot's user ID differs from the App ID.

`CheckoutRequest` requires `commitAuthor`. The local, SSH, and exe.dev executors set it as `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, and `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` in the parent's and children's environment, which git prefers to `user.name` and `user.email` in any config. The values aren't secret, so remote workers export them in the command line and the machine's sshd needs no `AcceptEnv` change.

The scheduler reads the bot account for each attempt and sets both `commitAuthor` and, on local and SSH workers, `botLogin` from it. If the account can't be read, the attempt fails before preparation: with an infrastructure failure, which is retried, or without a retry if GitHub refused, for example because the App has no installation.
